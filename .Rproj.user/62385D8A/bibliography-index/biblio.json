To master FMS, performance evaluation is necessary. In this study, we investigated the reliability of a new observational assessment tool.

In Phase II, rating scales were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated by comparing judgments of 30 undergraduate students to a standard. The mean weighted kappa (.71) was considered good (range .51-.85). Of the 11 rating scales, 6 were modified, and 5 remained unchanged.
