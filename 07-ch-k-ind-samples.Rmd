# K Independent Samples {#k-ind-samples}

In this chapter you you will learn how to test the mean differences between more than 2 samples. First, you will learn the basics of a procedure called **One-Way ANOVA**, which is a parametric test.

## SPSS Video & Written Tutorials

This chapter is under development. In the meantime, refer to the material below to learn how to run the One-Way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, including the interpretation of results.

## Practice

While in class, you will be asked to complete practice exercises using the following information:

### **Dataset**

-   [Download](https://canvas.csun.edu/courses/86127/files/11070842/download?wrap=1 "ksb-data02.sav") the dataset for this practice

### **Research questions**[^ch-k-ind-samples-1]

[^ch-k-ind-samples-1]: Even if you could use the t-test to answer some of the questions below, choose an F-test (analysis of variance test)

1.  Are boys and girls different when comes to bmi levels?
2.  Do girls from three different grade levels (6, 7, 8) perform differently on the pacer test?
3.  Do girls and boys from three different ethnicity groups (White, African American, and Asian) differ on the Shuttle-Run Post-test?
4.  Do girls and boys from three different grade levels (6, 7, 8) perform differently on the skill of throw?
5.  Do boys and girls perform differently on the skill of throw?

**For each of the research questions above, provide the following:**

1.  state the DV and the IV as well as the level of each of the variables (nominal, ordinal, scale)
2.  state the Ho and Ha
3.  state the level of significance the hypothesis will be tested (alpha level)
4.  if DV is continuous (interval or ratio), assume for now it normal
5.  based on the information provided in 4, state the procedure that will be used to test the hypothesis and provide 3 reasons why
6.  If needed, run the normality test with plots

**After conducting the test, provide the following:**

1.  the test statistic
2.  p-value calculated
3.  critical value required to reject the Ho
4.  was there a need for post-hoc analysis?
5.  what is the final decision?
6.  reject or keep the null? why?

### **A few things to consider:**

1.  [Check this note](https://hyp.is/vnqKalsOEemt3_uboggCYw/statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/one-way-anova-statistical-guide-3.php) on the robust test of equality of means

2.  [Check this note](https://hyp.is/9EgQ0h1sEeu0WPOOuv_5-Q/statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/kruskal-wallis-h-test-using-spss-statistics.php) on when to choose the Kruskal-Wallis mean ranks or median tests
