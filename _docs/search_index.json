This book is comprised of step-by-step tutorials showing how to perform analysis with SPSS and R. The emphasis of this book is not to teach students how to program in R or SPSS. Rather, the focus is on data analysis and interpretation using R and SPSS. Future versions of this book will contain topics related to hypothesis testing, descriptive and inferential statistics, etc. The goal is for this book to evolve into a textbook that may be used in Introductory Statistics courses taught at the undergraduate or graduate levels. Updates I announce major updates made to this book on Twitter. For updates, follow me at ofurtado3. Alternatively, you can subscribe to my blog www.drfurtado.us for updates. How to use this book To take full advantage of this book, I encourage you to download and install either RStudio or SPSS4. so that you can follow along. You will need to take some time to practice the tutorials using RStudio or SPSS. Besides, make sure to complete the challenge exercises you will encounter while studying the tutorials found throughout this book. FAQ Will you ever release the e-book version of this work? I’ve been asked whether this work will ever be published as an e-book or in paperback. The short answer is YES. However, I do not currently have a timeline. I encourage you to follow me on Twitter for updates. How much will it cost? I do not currently know how much it will cost. But I can ensure you that the e-book (and paperback) will be affordable. All the proceedings from the e-book will be donated to charities that help disadvantaged children in Brazil. I support mainly three charities in Brazil and the links are provided below.

Statistics would not exist without the concept of measurement. Measurement “is the process of comparing a value to a standard”[1]. When Iverson measures his 3rd-grade students’ proficiency on the vertical jump, he is comparing the performance with a standard, which in this particular case is how far up students can reach (inches). A measuring tape (the instrument) is used to collect bits of information. The information collected through this process is called data. Data can be quantitative or qualitative in nature. In the example above, the resulting data are quantitative, owing to the level of precision involved in the collection of data. A score of 15 inches assigned to a performer on the vertical jump test is not open for interpretation; it’s a precise (objective) measurement. On the other hand, if Iverson decides to assess (not measure) the qualitative aspects of the vertical jump (the form of the movement), he would have to rely on a different - more subjective - type of instrument. The FG-COMPASS [2] is an example of such a test. Participants are assessed on a scale from 1 through 4, with 1 being less proficient and 4 being more proficient. Iverson and his assistant may disagree when assigning scores to a given performance. Some disagreement is accepted, even expected, between observers, owing to the subjective nature of the scale being used. Inter-rater reliability, sometimes called objectivity, can be used to verify the level of agreement. 1.2 Variables In the context of Statistics, variables can be classified into two general types: numerical or categorical. Numerical variables can take on 1.2.1 Types of variables 1.2.2 Classification of data 1.2.3 Choosing the correct test Choosing the correct test for a particular research study is not an easy task. This is mainly because one… book, and any statistics resource for that matter, will not be very helpful if you didn’t do your homework and by that I mean: spent time drafting your research question(s) and hypothesis(es); list your dependent variable(s) and independent variable(s) for each of the proposed hypotheses. An example will help illustrate the point being made here.To get started, let’s import a dataset (data01), which is saved in my computer.

Wikipedia5 has a comprehensive list of statistical software, which is worth checking out. Below, I will show you how to download and install R, RStudio, and SPSS. I strongly recommend you to download the application of your choice and follow along. C.1 Package Download &amp; Installation In this section, you’ll find all you need to get started with RStudio and SPSS. Both computer packages are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. C.1.1 R and RStudio R is an open-source computer package used for statistical data analysis and graphics. RStudio combines several tools in one single computer package, which helps one be more productive when using R. Although you can use R by itself, the tutorials for this book were developed using RStudio. Thus, to follow along, please download both R and RStudio. Standalone Version First, download and install R from this link6: http://bit.ly/3bBLKHO Then, download and install RStudio from this link: http://bit.ly/2D8H7EU To take full advantage of R, you will need to install a few R packages7 as they are required to run most of the statistical analysis and to create graphs. YouTube8 has several video tutorials showing how to install these applications. RStudio Cloud If you don’t want to download/install R and RStudio, you can use the cloud version of RStudio, provided you have access to the Internet. Simply, follow the link below to create a free account and use RStudio online, without the need to install anything in your computer. https://rstudio.cloud C.1.2 SPSS Contrary to R, SPSS is not free. However, you can download and use SPSS for 14 days by visiting this link: http://ibm.co/2brfyu1. Hearne Software offers SPSS licenses that last 6, 12, or 24 months. This is specially helpful if you are taking an undergraduate or graduate course and needs access to SPSS for the time the course is being taught. Ensure to ask your instructor which package will be necessary, provided the requirements of the course. They offers premium, standard, and base license packages.
