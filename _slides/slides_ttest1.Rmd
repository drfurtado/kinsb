# Parametric vs Non-parametric

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}

```

Use the table above to decide when to use a parametric or non-parametric test.

# Objectives

After studying chapters 11 & 12, students should be able to:

> - understand the fundamentals of t-test
> - learn the steps used to calculate two types of t-tests (independent and paired-samples)
> - interpret SPSS output and write up the results
> - understand the difference between statistical significance and practical significance

# Analyzing mean differences

**One-Sample:** 

- A sample mean may be used as an estimate of a population mean.

> - Can test the probability that the population mean lies within a certain CI using the sample mean as a predictor.

**Now, we will reverse the technique above**

> - To determine whether a given sample is likely to have been randomly selected from a specific population.
> - In theory, if two samples drawn (randomly) from the sample population, their means should be the same (or similar) --> Now...

# Analyzing mean differences

If *two* samples were drawn from the **same population** and their means are **statistically different**, then:

> 1. One or both samples were not randomly drawn from the population
> 2. Some factor has affected one or both samples, causing them to deviate from the population from which they were originally drawn.

> - When we conduct a research project and have reason to believe that two groups are different & we are dealing with parametric data (interval & ratio), a t-test may be used to test statistical significance.

# Analyzing mean differences

> - Data must be a continuous scale (ratio or interval)
> - Basic design
>   + Control group (e.g., gets the placebo)
>   + Treatment/experimental group (e.g., gets the innovative intervention)
> - We would not expect the means to be identical, they would likely be different
> - t-test answers the following question:
>   + Is there a statistical difference between the control and the experimental groups? Or…
>   + Is there a statistical difference between males and females on a given dependent variable?

# Assumptions of *t*-tests

> - Variables --> 1 DV & 1 IV (max two levels)^[male/female; pre/post-test; etc.]
> - Sample distribution normal (check for normality before proceeding)
>   + If normal --> proceed with test
>   + If NOT normal, n = 30 or more & **randomly drawn from a population** ($\mu$), then proceed with test
>   + Otherwise, choose the **Mann-Whitney U-test**

# Assumptions of *t*-test (cont.)

> - Homogeneity of variance (shouldn’t be more than twice as large as the variance of the other)
>   + For more accuracy use the Levene’s test
> - Parametric data (interval or ratio scales)
