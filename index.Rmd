# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a companion book[^index-1] used in a course[^index-2] I teach at [Cal State Northridge](https://academics.csun.edu/faculty/ovande.furtado){target="_blank"}. This book is comprised of step-by-step tutorials showing how to perform analysis with SPSS and *R*.

[^index-2]: KIN610 - Quantitative Analysis of Research in Kinesiology

The emphasis of this book is not to teach students how to program in *R* or SPSS. Rather, the focus is on **data analysis and interpretation** using *R* and SPSS.

Future versions of this book will contain topics related to **hypothesis testing**, **descriptive and inferential statistics**, etc. The goal is for this book to evolve into a textbook that may be used in Introductory Statistics courses taught at the undergraduate or graduate levels.

**How to use this book**

To take full advantage of this book, I encourage you to download and install either RStudio or SPSS[^index-4]. so that you can follow along. You will need to take some time to practice the tutorials using RStudio or SPSS. Besides, make sure to complete the challenge exercises you will encounter while studying the tutorials found throughout this book.

[^index-4]: *R* is free to download and use whereas SPSS is a paid application. However, there is a 14-day free trial to use SPSS

**FAQ**

Will you ever release the e-book version of this work?

> I've been asked whether this work will ever be published as an e-book or in paperback. The short answer is YES. However, I do not currently have a timeline. I encourage you to follow me on Twitter for updates.

How much will it cost?

> I do not currently know how much it will cost. But I can ensure you that the e-book (and paperback) will be affordable. All the proceedings from the e-book will be donated to charities that help disadvantaged children in Brazil. I support mainly three charities in Brazil and the links are provided below.
